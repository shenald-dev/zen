Observation / Pruned:
The codebase was burdened by a heavy background progress thread from `rich` that woke up constantly while the main thread slept. The optimization correctly zeroed this overhead, enforcing an active event loop model for TUI rendering. Also pruned unused test dependencies.

Alignment / Deferred:
Updated documentation to promote the new zero-overhead execution path. Bumped safety boundaries of dependencies (`rich>=13.9.0`, `typer>=0.12.0`) to solidify stability against older library bugs. Cut patch release v0.1.1.
